Outliers are identified as values that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. In this function, for each specified column (Open, High, Low, Close), values outside this range are replaced with NaN. Finally, rows containing NaN values are dropped from the dataset. This method effectively filters out extreme values that skew statistical analysis or model performance based on their deviation from the dataset's central tendency."

The model achieved high R-squared scores of 0.99 on both training and test datasets, indicating a strong fit. The low mean squared error (MSE) values of 50.04 for training and 82.43 for testing further validated the model's predictive accuracy.\n",

        "In summary, the project effectively utilized machine learning techniques, specifically Ridge regression, to predict stock prices with high accuracy. The rigorous data preprocessing, careful model selection, and thorough evaluation highlighted the robustness of the methodology. Future work could involve exploring additional models or advanced feature engineering techniques to further enhance the predictive capabilities."
